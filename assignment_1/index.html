        <!-- About Me -->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <em>I live, breathe, and speak climbing. Existing in the mountains is my passion & career. I want to share these special places with you.</em>
        <p>
            I began mountain guiding professionally in 2013 around the San Juan Mountains of southwest Colorado. Rock climbing in the spring & fall, alpine climbing in the summer, and ice climbing & skiing in the winter.
        </P>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2017, I moved to Washington State to work & gain experience in the North Cascades – a dramatic, rugged, complicated, and heavily glaciated mountain range.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fall, winter, and spring are currently spent in Red Rock Canyon. Just minutes outside of Las Vegas, Red Rock provides access to the longest & easiest multi-pitch trad climbing in the US.
        </p>
            In the summer of 2020, I’m looking forward to intimately learning a new mountain range – The Teton Range in Wyoming.

            I’m excited and honored to primarily work with the following listed companies. These companies are authorized permittees in the locations for which I offer climbing.

            If you’d like to climb in a location not currently listed, please get in touch! We may be able to put a trip together using permit sharing via a company that has access.
        </p>
        <p>
            All trips must go through a guide service with access to permits. If I am unable to help you, I’m happy to recommend and put you in touch with someone who can.
